## My process

In this project, I used html and css. I first sketched the challenge on a piece of paper and try to visualize and breakdown its layout. Then i wrote the layout in html using semantic tags, wrote the content, and provided the necessary classes. These classes are then used in the css file to style the components of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I reinforced my understanding of semantic tags, how to import custom fonts, css grid, layout, and so much more.

### Continued development

I look forward to learning more about creating css styles reusable components.
